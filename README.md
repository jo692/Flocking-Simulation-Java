# Flocking-Simulation-Java
Program attempting to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds.

Project for a uni module, not a great implementation of the flocking behaviour but offers some interesting visuals.
Includes buttons to add/remove agents with a speed slider. Note, the program is prone to errors if too many agents are added. The agents will initially move in straight lines until they come within proximity of another agent, upon which they will begin moving together.

Background image never implemented successfully despite being in the code.
